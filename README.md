# gammakde
Compton edge analysis with kernel density estimation in python and mathematica
Especially organized for AGU lightning presentation

Add to poster: I worked on plastic anticoincidence detectors, "veto panels", calibrating repeatedly


Todo 
[x] Confirm Mathematica Theory figures
[ ] MEGAlib simulation of veto panel setup
    [ ] Get pretty screencap of green gammas in simple detector
[ ] Rewrite KDE analysis code
[ ] Analyze MEGAlib simulated data
